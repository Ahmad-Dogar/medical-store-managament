medical store managament system 

The Medical Store Management System is a web-based application built in PHP that streamlines the process of managing a medical store. With this application, pharmacists and other staff can easily store medicines data, create bills, and manage the inventory of the store.

The system includes a comprehensive database that stores information about medicines, including their name, dosage, manufacturer date, and price. This information can be easily accessed and updated by authorized staff members. The system also includes features for managing the inventory of the store, allowing staff to keep track of stock levels, set re-order points.

One of the standout features of this system is the ability to create bills and save data. Pharmacists can easily enter information about a customer's prescription, select the appropriate medicines from the database, and generate a bill with accurate pricing information. The system also saves this data for future reference, allowing staff to easily retrieve past bills and other customer information.
